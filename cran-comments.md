## R CMD check results

R CMD check done via `devtools::check()`, resulting in 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes. More thorough checks identified one warning (about a possibly misspelled word that was ultimately a false positive) and an invalid URI in the README (which I thank the CRAN crew for finding).
