**stevetemplates** is an R package to help you create lovely R Markdown documents, primarily for conversion to LaTeX PDFs. This R package is a work in progress, though you may have already seen [my templates](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates) before. Check them out here. I'll be migrating them to an R package soon.
