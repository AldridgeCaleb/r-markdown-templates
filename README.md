**stevetemplates** is an R package to help you create lovely R Markdown documents, primarily for conversion to LaTeX PDFs. This R package is a work in progress, though you may have already seen [my templates](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates) before. Check them out here. I'll be migrating them to an R package soon.

Right now, my latest manuscript template is available to use via this package. I'll add the others soon.

You can download it right now if you'd like.

```r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/stevetemplates")
```
